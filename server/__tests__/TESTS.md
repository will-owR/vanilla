# Test Documentation (Consolidated)

This document consolidates all tests found under `server/__tests__`.

**Note:** This is a living document and must reflect the current state of tests. Please update as new tests are added or existing ones are modified. (Last updated: November 7, 2025)

> ERROR: Test failure observed
>
> - Failing test: `server/__tests__/aiService.test.js` → "API: /prompt (AI Processing Layer)" → should return a structured AI response for a valid prompt
> - What failed: the test posted a prompt and received promptId/resultId, but a subsequent GET to `/api/prompts/:promptId` returned 404 instead of 200. The assertion expected a 200 OK and the stored prompt's data to match the original prompt.
> - Possible cause: mixed persistence backends — the writer used the Prisma-backed `utils/dbUtils` (or another DB client) to create the prompt/result while the API GET handler used the legacy sqlite `crud` layer to read the prompt. This results in the POST and GET hitting different stores, so the GET cannot find the newly-created row.
>
> Recommended diagnostics:
>
> 1. Confirm which persistence implementation was used during the failing test (look for logs from `defaultModule` / `genieService` that indicate whether `utils/dbUtils` or `crud` was resolved).
> 2. Re-run the test with `GENIE_PERSISTENCE_ENABLED` and `USE_PRISMA_IN_TEST` toggled to see whether forcing the legacy `crud` backend makes the GET succeed.
> 3. As a longer-term fix, ensure read endpoints prefer `utils/dbUtils` when available or implement a unified persistence adapter so reads and writes use the same store.

---

### Export Integration (`export.integration.test.js`)

Purpose: End-to-end verification of the `/export` endpoint using Puppeteer.

What it does:

- Starts the app programmatically (no network listen)
- Waits for `/health` to be `ok`
- Posts `{ title, body }` to `/export`
- Asserts a 200 response with `application/pdf` and a non-empty binary buffer

Dependencies: `vitest`, `supertest`, `puppeteer-core`, plus a system Chrome/Chromium or `CHROME_PATH` configured.

Run:

```
cd server
npm run test:run -- export.integration.test.js
```

CI note: The CI job must install a system Chrome/Chromium binary or set `CHROME_PATH`. See `.github/workflows/server-tests-pr.yml`.

---

### PDF Quality (`pdfQuality.integration.test.mjs`)

Purpose: Integration tests for PDF quality, validates content rendering, and tests PDF metadata and structure.

Run:

```
cd server
npx vitest run __tests__/pdfQuality.integration.test.mjs --run
```

---

### Export Handler (`export-handler.test.js`)

Purpose: Tests export endpoint request handling and validates error cases and edge conditions.

Run:

```
cd server
npm run test:run -- export-handler.test.js
```

---

### Export Text Verification (`export_text.test.mjs`)

Purpose: End-to-end verification of the `/api/export/book` endpoint that asserts:

- The response is a valid PDF (magic bytes `%PDF-`).
- The extracted PDF text contains expected poem titles (uses `server/scripts/extract-pdf-text.js`).

What it does:

- Starts the app programmatically (no network listen), ensuring DB and Puppeteer are initialized.
- Posts to `/api/export/book` and captures the binary response.
- Writes the buffer to a temp file and calls `server/scripts/extract-pdf-text.js` to extract text for assertions.

Run:

```
cd server
npx vitest run __tests__/export_text.test.mjs --run
```

Notes:

- This test uses a subprocess to run the extraction script to avoid importing `pdf-parse` directly inside the test process (some versions run debug code on import).
- For CI, see the `verify-export` script in `server/package.json` which runs the smoke export and extraction.

---

### PDF Generator (`pdfGenerator.test.mjs`)

Purpose: Unit tests for PDF generation utilities, testing formatting and layout options.

Run:

```
cd server
npx vitest run __tests__/pdfGenerator.test.mjs --run
```

---

### Puppeteer PDF Flow (`test-puppeteer-pdf.js`)

Purpose: Functional verification that a Puppeteer-driven PDF flow creates a file and returns a buffer.

Run:

```
cd server
npm run test:run -- test-puppeteer-pdf.js
```

CI note: Requires Chrome/Chromium.

---

## E2E Tests

### Summer Poems Flow (`e2e.summer-poems.test.mjs`)

Purpose: Full export flow with stubbed AI services, testing deterministic poem generation and export, and validating the complete user journey.

Run:

```
cd server
npx vitest run __tests__/e2e.summer-poems.test.mjs --run
```

---

```markdown
## General Notes

- Tests run under Vitest
- Use `npm test` for interactive watch mode
- Use `npm run test:run` for CI-friendly runs
- Integration and Puppeteer-based tests need Chrome/Chromium
- Some tests can be gated behind environment variables for CI optimization
