**Go/No-Go Criteria**:

- ✅ Stage 1 must deliver 44%+ API reduction for 8-page books
- ✅ Stage 2 must integrate images without breaking Stage 1
- ✅ Stage 3 decision point: measure Stage 2 latency impact, trigger only if >25% overhead

**Next Steps**: See "Implementation Timeline" and "Next Steps" sections below for detailed roadmap

## Problem Statement (Corrected)

### The Actual Optimization Problem

```
Given:
  • Flash model can generate N pages in one API request
  • Gemini API rate limit: 10 requests/minute (6s minimum between sequential requests)
  • Target ebook range: 3-20 pages (primary use case)
  • Page 1 must be individual (establishes narrative voice)
  • Page N must be individual (conclusion/wrap-up)
  • Future: Image generation will add to API call count

Find:
  Optimal batching strategy for pages 2 through N-1 such that:
  • Total API calls minimized within rate limit constraint
  • Narrative quality maintained (unified batch context)
  • Implementation is pragmatic and testable
  • Strategy accommodates future image generation requests
```

### Why Previous Approach Was Wrong

The archived `RECONFIG-BATCH_OPTIMIZATION.md` proposed **Scenario D (Hybrid Strategy)** with three escalating complexity levels:

- **Stage 1**: Fixed 3-page batches (6-15 page range)
- **Stage 2**: Dynamic sqrt(N) sizing (15-50 page range)
- **Stage 3**: Parallel execution (50+ pages)

**Problems with that approach**:

1. **Out-of-scope optimization**: Stages 2 and 3 optimize for book sizes beyond actual use case (20+ pages)
2. **Misdiagnosed constraint**: Proposed parallelization to overcome rate limit, but rate limit is **hard constraint** that parallelization cannot solve
3. **Inflated performance claims**: 80-94% improvements were for 100+ page books, not relevant to 3-20 page target
4. **Missing critical dependency**: Image generation coming next—should be planned now, not treated as surprise later
5. **Premature complexity**: Three different algorithms instead of single pragmatic solution

---

## Corrected Architecture

### Constraint Analysis

#### Rate Limit is Binding, Not CPU

```
Gemini API: 10 requests/minute = 1 request every 6 seconds minimum

Current Sequential Approach (no batching):
├─ Structure (Pro) - 1 call @ t=0s
├─ Ch1 (Flash) - 1 call @ t=6s
├─ Ch2 (Flash) - 1 call @ t=12s
├─ ... (sequential, rate-limited)
├─ ChN (Flash) - 1 call @ t=6(N+1)s
└─ Total: (N+1) calls, latency = 6(N+1) seconds

With Fixed 3-Page Batches:
├─ Structure (Pro) - 1 call @ t=0s
├─ Ch1 (Flash) - 1 call @ t=6s
├─ [Ch2-4 batch] (Flash) - 1 call @ t=12s
├─ [Ch5-7 batch] (Flash) - 1 call @ t=18s
├─ ... (batches still sequential, rate-limited)
├─ ChN (Flash) - 1 call @ t=6(ceil((N-2)/3)+2)s
└─ Total: ceil((N-2)/3)+3 calls, latency = 6(ceil((N-2)/3)+2) seconds

Example (8-page book):
├─ Sequential: 9 calls, 54 seconds
├─ Fixed batches: 5 calls, 30 seconds
└─ Improvement: 44% fewer calls, 44% latency reduction (both constrained by rate limit)
```

**Key insight**: Cannot parallelize batch requests within rate limit without sophisticated queue management. Parallelization only helps if rate limit is lifted.

#### Unified Batch Context is Quality Win

```
Without batching (current):
  └─ Each page sees only previous page summary
  └─ Risk: Weak narrative connections, pacing misalignment

With fixed 3-page batches:
  ├─ Page 1: Individual (establishes voice)
  ├─ Pages 2-4: Batched with full ebook outline, Ch1 summary, narrative arc
  │   └─ Can coordinate pacing, tone, thematic consistency
  ├─ Pages 5-7: Batched with full context
  │   └─ Continues established voice, escalates conflict/tension
  └─ Page 8: Individual (conclusion)

Result: 3-page narrative coherence > 1-page isolation
```

This is the **primary benefit** beyond API reduction—better ebook quality.

---

## Solution Strategy

### Stage 1: Fixed 3-Page Batch Strategy (3-20 page range)

**Approach**: Batch pages 2 through N-1 in fixed 3-page groups

```
Architecture:
├─ Structure generation (1 call)
│  └─ Output: Full ebook outline, theme, narrative arc
├─ Page 1 (individual, 1 call)
│  └─ Output: Establishes voice, establishes tone, introduces protagonist
├─ [Batch 1: Pages 2-4] (1 call)
│  └─ Context: structure + page 1 summary + full narrative arc
│  └─ Request: "Generate pages 2-4 as unified narrative arc"
├─ [Batch 2: Pages 5-7] (1 call)
│  └─ Context: structure + page 1 summary + full narrative arc
│  └─ Request: "Generate pages 5-7 continuing established voice"
├─ ... (repeat as needed)
└─ Page N (individual, 1 call)
   └─ Output: Conclusion, resolution, final thoughts

Performance (3-20 page range):

| N | Sequential | Fixed-3 | Improvement | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 4 | 2 | 50% | 12s vs 24s |
| 5 | 6 | 3 | 50% | 18s vs 36s |
| 8 | 9 | 5 | 44% | 30s vs 54s |
| 12 | 13 | 6 | 46% | 36s vs 78s |
| 15 | 16 | 7 | 56% | 42s vs 96s |
| 20 | 21 | 9 | 57% | 54s vs 126s |
```

**Implementation**:

```javascript
async function generateEbookWithBatching(ebook) {
  const sessionId = generateUUID();
  METRICS.startSession(sessionId, ebook);

  // Step 1: Generate structure
  const structure = await generateStructure(ebook);
  METRICS.recordStructure(sessionId, structure);

  // Step 2: Generate page 1 (establishes voice)
  const page1 = await generatePage(1, { structure });
  METRICS.recordPage(sessionId, 1, page1);

  // Step 3: Build unified context for batch requests
  const batchContext = {
    structure,
    page1Summary: extractSummary(page1),
    narrativeVoice: extractVoice(page1),
    tone: extractTone(page1),
    ebook: { title: ebook.title, theme: ebook.theme },
  };

  // Step 4: Generate middle pages in 3-page batches
  const pageCount = ebook.pageCount;
  const BATCH_SIZE = 3;
  const batches = [];

  for (let i = 2; i < pageCount; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
    const batchEnd = Math.min(i + BATCH_SIZE - 1, pageCount - 1);
    const batchPages = [
      i,
      Math.min(i + 1, batchEnd),
      Math.min(i + 2, batchEnd),
    ].filter((p) => p < pageCount);

    const batch = await generateBatch(batchPages, batchContext);
    batches.push(...batch);
    METRICS.recordBatch(sessionId, batchPages, batch);
  }

  // Step 5: Generate final page (conclusion)
  const finalPage = await generatePage(pageCount, {
    structure,
    ...batchContext,
  });
  METRICS.recordPage(sessionId, pageCount, finalPage);

  // Assemble complete ebook
  const allPages = [page1, ...batches, finalPage];
  METRICS.finalizeSession(sessionId, allPages);

  return {
    pages: allPages,
    metrics: METRICS.getSessionMetrics(sessionId),
  };
}
```

**Error Recovery**:

1. **Batch-level failure**: If batch request fails, fall back to individual page generation
2. **Transient error (429 rate limit)**: Exponential backoff, retry with longer delay
3. **Complete failure**: Log error, return best-effort partial ebook

**Observability**:

- Track per-batch latency (compare to rate limit baseline)
- Monitor batch quality metrics (coherence, pacing consistency)
- Alert if batches consistently underperform sequential

### Stage 2: Image Generation Integration (Weeks 3-4)

**Approach**: Add per-page image generation to pipeline, measure impact

```
Architecture (with images):
├─ Structure generation (1 call)
├─ Page 1 text (1 call)
├─ Page 1 images (3 calls, assuming 3 images per page)
├─ [Batch 1: Pages 2-4 text] (1 call)
├─ [Batch 1: Pages 2-4 images] (3 calls per page = 9 calls)
├─ [Batch 2: Pages 5-7 text] (1 call)
├─ [Batch 2: Pages 5-7 images] (3 calls per page = 9 calls)
├─ ... (repeat as needed)
└─ Page N text (1 call)
   Page N images (3 calls)

Example (8-page book with 3 images/page):
├─ Text calls: 5 (structure=1, ch1=1, batches=2, final=1)
├─ Image calls: 24 (8 pages × 3 images = 24)
└─ Total: 29 calls (vs. 9 without images)
   Latency: 29 × 6s = 174s (significantly longer)
```

**Decision Point**: After Stage 2, measure actual latency impact.

- **If images add <25% latency overhead**: Stage 1 + Stage 2 sufficient, **no Stage 3 needed**
- **If images add >25% latency overhead**: Proceed to Stage 3 (parallel image generation)

### Stage 3: Parallel Image Generation (Conditional)

**Trigger**: Only if Stage 2 shows >25% latency overhead from images

**Approach**: Generate images in parallel for each batch group

```
Architecture (parallel images):
├─ Structure generation (1 call)
├─ Page 1 text (1 call)
├─ Page 1 images (parallel, but wait for completion)
├─ [Batch 1: Pages 2-4 text] (1 call)
├─ [Batch 1: Pages 2-4 images] (parallel promise.all, 9 concurrent requests
│   └─ Hit rate limit ceiling, but overlap reduces sequential overhead)
├─ [Batch 2: Pages 5-7 text] (1 call)
├─ [Batch 2: Pages 5-7 images] (parallel, 9 concurrent requests)
└─ Page N text (1 call)
   Page N images (parallel)

Rate Limit Management:
  └─ Queue-based rate limiter: respect 10 req/min across all concurrent image requests
  └─ Within each batch: parallelize, but throttle to queue size = 2-3 concurrent
```

**Implementation** (pseudocode):

```javascript
async function generateBatchWithParallelImages(batchPages, batchContext) {
  // Generate text for batch pages
  const textBatch = await generateBatch(batchPages, batchContext);

  // Generate images in parallel (but throttled by rate limiter)
  const imagePromises = textBatch.flatMap((page) =>
    page.requiredImages.map((imgSpec) =>
      RATE_LIMITER.enqueue(() => generateImage(imgSpec, page))
    )
  );

  const images = await Promise.all(imagePromises);

  // Attach images to pages
  textBatch.forEach((page, idx) => {
    page.images = images.filter((img) => img.pageNumber === page.number);
  });

  return textBatch;
}
```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ If Stage 2 image latency <25% overhead: Stop here, no Stage 3
- ✅ If Stage 2 image latency >25% overhead: Stage 3 achieves <15% additional overhead

---

## Success Criteria

### Stage 1 (Fixed 3-page batches for 3-20 pages)

- ✅ 44%+ API reduction across 3-20 page range
- ✅ Unified batch context implemented (narrative quality improvement measurable)
- ✅ Error recovery for failed batches (fallback to individual pages)
- ✅ Observability metrics operational (per-batch latency, quality tracking)
- ✅ Clear documentation: "Optimized for 3-20 page ebooks with 10 req/min rate limit"

### Stage 2 (Image generation integration)

- ✅ Per-page image generation working
- ✅ Batch pipeline accepts image generation in pipeline
- ✅ Total latency measured (pages + images combined)
- ✅ Decision made: Is Stage 3 needed? (assess >25% overhead threshold)

### Stage 3 (Parallel image generation, conditional)

Only pursue if Stage 2 shows >25% overhead:

- ✅ Parallel image generation within batch groups
- ✅ Rate limit queue management (<10 req/min enforced)
- ✅ Latency improvement demonstrated (<15% additional overhead)
- ✅ Backward compatible with Stage 1 + Stage 2

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Rate Limit Exceeded (429 errors)

**Current**: Exponential backoff + fallback to individual pages  
**With Images**: Image requests will increase pressure on rate limit  
**Mitigation**:

- Implement sliding-window rate limiter from project start
- Track per-image latency separately from text generation
- Stage 3 decision based on actual data

### Risk: Narrative Quality Degradation

**Concern**: Batching 3 pages at once might lose narrative coherence  
**Mitigation**:

- Unified context includes full ebook outline (not just previous page)
- Explicit prompt guidance for 3-page narrative continuity
- Quality metrics tracked per batch in Stage 1
- A/B testing: Compare batch output vs. individual page output

### Risk: Image Generation Complexity

**Concern**: Image generation will significantly extend latency  
**Mitigation**:

- Stage 2 explicitly measures impact
- Stage 3 parallelization strategy ready if needed
- Can defer image feature if latency unacceptable

---

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Target Scope is 3-20 Pages (Final)

**Decision**: Batch optimization is specifically for 3-20 page ebooks, not arbitrary sizes  
**Rationale**:

- Primary use case is standard ebooks (short to medium length)
- Rate limit constraint makes larger books impractical (not technology problem)
- Narrative quality matters most in this range
  **Action**: All documentation explicitly states this scope

### Decision 2: Unified Batch Context for Quality

**Decision**: All batches include full ebook context, not just previous page summary  
**Rationale**:

- Enables narrative arc awareness
- Improves tone/pacing consistency
- Is the **primary benefit** beyond API reduction
  **Action**: Batch prompt design prioritizes this context

### Decision 3: Conditional Stage 3, Not Mandatory

**Decision**: Stage 3 (parallel images) only triggered if Stage 2 shows >25% overhead  
**Rationale**:

- Parallel complexity not justified if images don't bottleneck
- Can measure actual impact before committing to implementation
- Keeps codebase simpler if not needed
  **Action**: Stage 2 includes explicit decision criteria

### Decision 4: Rate Limit is Binding Constraint

**Decision**: Accept 10 req/min as hard limit; don't plan around overcoming it  
**Rationale**:

- It's a Gemini API policy, not a technical problem
- Parallelization only works within rate limit (with sophisticated queuing)
- Batch strategy optimizes within constraint, not against it
  **Action**: All performance claims based on sequential rate-limited baseline

## Implementation Timeline

| Stage       | Duration             | Key Deliverables                                         | Success Metric                          |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Stage 1** | Weeks 1-2            | Fixed 3-page batching, error recovery, observability     | 44%+ API reduction in 3-20 range        |
| **Stage 2** | Weeks 3-4            | Image integration, latency measurement, Stage 3 decision | <50% total latency increase with images |
| **Stage 3** | Weeks 5+ (if needed) | Parallel image generation, rate limit queue              | <15% additional overhead if triggered   |

**Total estimate**: 2-4 weeks (depends on Stage 2 findings)

## Next Steps

1. **Approve corrected scope** (3-20 pages, rate limit binding)
2. **Begin Stage 1 implementation** (fixed 3-page batches)
3. **Add observability hooks** (per-batch metrics, quality tracking)
4. **Plan Stage 2** (image generation integration points)
5. **Document scope limitations** in all user-facing materials

## Conclusion

**DECISION MADE**: We are pursuing **Fixed Batch Strategy with Conditional Image Optimization**.

### Why This Approach?

1. **Pragmatic**: Stage 1 delivers 44%+ improvement immediately for actual use case (3-20 pages)
2. **Adaptive**: Stage 2 explicitly measures image impact, Stage 3 only triggered if data warrants
3. **Quality-focused**: Unified batch context is primary benefit beyond API reduction
4. **Rate-limit aware**: Accepts Gemini API constraint as binding, optimizes within it
5. **Focused scope**: Ignores out-of-scope optimizations (50+ page books)
6. **Future-ready**: Plans for image generation now, doesn't treat it as surprise

### Implementation Path

**Stage 1** (This sprint): Fixed 3-page batching for 3-20 pages

- Sequential 3-page batches
- Full error recovery + observability
- 44-57% API reduction in target range
- Narrative quality improvement (unified context)

**Stage 2** (Next sprint): Image generation integration

- Per-page image generation in pipeline
- Measure total latency (pages + images)
- Make Stage 3 decision: Is >25% image overhead acceptable?

**Stage 3** (Following sprint, if needed): Parallel image generation

- Only if Stage 2 shows >25% image overhead
- Parallel image requests within rate limit queue
- Target <15% additional overhead

### Success Metrics

- ✅ Stage 1: 44%+ API reduction (target: 8-page baseline = 44%)
- ✅ Stage 2: Total latency with images measured and decision made
- ✅ Stage 3: Only pursued if Stage 2 justifies it

This approach balances **pragmatism** (immediate value for real use case), **adaptability** (images assessed via data, not assumptions), and **focus** (delivers best solution for 3-20 pages, ignores out-of-scope sizes).
