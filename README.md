# AetherPress Prototype - Welcome

The goal is a quick-build prototype involving a Node.js backend (for Puppeteer compatibility and potentially Express/FastAPI) and a modern frontend SPA (Svelte). This project demonstrates the foundational architecture for a quick-build prototype of AetherPress, focusing on the core loop: Prompt -> AI Processing -> Preview -> Basic Override -> PDF Export.

Demo goal: produce an A4 eBook of public-domain summer poems — one poem per page with a poem-describing decorative background image (see `docs/DEMO_README.md`).

## Development Philosophy

We maintain stability through structured change management:

1. Discuss and understand the full context
2. Document agreements and decisions
3. Create actionable, phased plans
4. Implement incrementally

All contributors, human and AI, must:

- Start with README.md
- Respect project structure
- Follow established patterns
- Propose changes that align with architecture

This approach prevents destabilizing changes and maintains our clean, component-based architecture.
🚨 **All contributors must read and follow the Development Philosophy before making any changes.** 🚨

## Vision

To empower creators (writers, poets, educators, marketers) to effortlessly design and publish visually stunning, graphically rich eBooks, leveraging AI for enhanced creativity, efficiency, and personalization by:

- Delivering eye-catching, benchmark-quality drafts at lightning speed.
- Empowering users with modular, precise control over every aspect of their eBook.
- Acting as your creative partner—the AI handles the heavy lifting, leaving you free to perfect your vision.

## Unified Testing & Module System (Summary)

**Client tests**: Powered by Vitest for fast, modern Svelte development.
**Server tests**: Powered by Vitest for Node.js/JavaScript workflows.
**Module System**: CommonJS (CJS) is used in the backend for compatibility; ESM is used in the frontend for Svelte/Vite.

## Project Structure

- `server/` — All backend code (Express server, Puppeteer, modules)
- `client/` — Svelte frontend SPA
- `data/` — (Optional) Database files
- `samples/` — Sample files (e.g., PNGs, PDFs)
- `docs/` — Project documentation
- `shared/` — Code or assets shared between client and server (e.g., utility functions, types, or constants).
- `config/` — Configuration files (e.g., environment settings, service credentials, or build configs).

## Technology Vibe

- **Client:** Modern, component-based JS framework (Vite/Svelte). Focus on a clean, responsive UI.
- **Server:** Scalable platform (Express/Node.js). Ready to orchestrate multiple API calls.
- **Database:** For a balance of structure and flexibility (PostgreSQL/JSONB).
  - Production deployments can use any PostgreSQL-compatible service (Azure Database, AWS RDS, etc.)
  - Postgres is now the default for local and smoke tests (the migration is in place and `docs/focus/GUI_RESOLUTION.md` formalizes integration steps).
  - See `/server/index.js` for the current health check implementation and TODO note.
- **AI:**
  - **Default:** Use Google's Gemini for both text and image generation.
  - Leverage best-in-class third-party APIs for core GenAI (image generation, possibly LLM for assistant). Build custom logic for agent orchestration and workflow, not foundational models.
  - Support use of [GitHub Models](https://github.com/features/models) for discovery and experimentation with AI models (for free).
- **PDF Generation:** Use a proven, robust library, puppeteer for HTML-to-PDF.
- **Persistence:** Standard database for user accounts, projects, preferences, asset metadata.

## Key Features

- **Prompt Engine ("The Magic Wand"):**  
  Uses natural language processing to interpret your creative prompt, ensuring that your ideas—no matter how abstract—are understood and transformed into content.

- **AI Orchestrator ("The Conductor"):**  
  Seamlessly manages the AI Content Agent, Image Agent, Layout Engine, and Assembly Engine to balance creativity with consistency.

- **Modular Dashboard ("The Control Panel"):**  
  Provides distinct modules for content, images, layout, and settings, allowing for targeted tweaks without disrupting your entire project.

- **Dynamic Live Preview & Export:**  
  See changes in near real-time and export a high-fidelity PDF that mirrors the live preview down to the pixel.

## API Endpoints (Core Loop)

1. **POST /prompt** — Accepts a `prompt` and returns generated content
2. **GET /preview** — Returns an HTML preview for given content
3. **POST /override** — Accepts `content` and `override`, returns updated content
4. **GET /export** — Returns a PDF file for given content

## Implementation Notes

- **PDF Generation**: Uses Puppeteer for production-level HTML-to-PDF rendering
- **AI Service Abstraction**: Centralized logic for text and image generation
- **Template-Based Layouts**: Dynamic HTML/CSS templates for content and image rendering

## Future Enhancements

- Asynchronous processing for better performance
- Enhanced UI/UX
- User authentication and session management
- Expanded database schema for more complex workflows

## Getting Started

### Backend

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   (This runs the Express server from `/server/index.js`.)

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   (This runs the Svelte app on Vite.)

### Access the Application

- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Backend API**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## CI/CD Workflows

For a detailed summary and assessment of the GitHub Actions workflows used in this project, please see the `WORKFLOWS.md` document located in the `.github/workflows/` directory. This document provides an overview of each workflow's purpose, the triggers, and the key jobs they perform.

CI and local artifact handling

- The repository ignores runtime test artifacts (`test-artifacts/`, `server/test-artifacts/`, `client/test-artifacts/`) to avoid committing large or temporary files. CI jobs still upload runner-produced artifacts for debugging. To reproduce artifact generation locally, run the headless preview script or smoke-export script and check the `test-artifacts/` directory (created locally):

```bash
# generate preview artifacts (local)
# When run from the repo root, the client script writes into `client/test-artifacts/`.
node client/scripts/headless-preview-e2e.cjs || node client/scripts/headless-preview-e2e.js

# run export smoke and extract text
# run server smoke-export (writes to a temp dir; CI copies artifacts to `server/test-artifacts/`)
bash server/scripts/smoke-export.sh
node server/scripts/extract-pdf-text.js /tmp/your-ebook.pdf

Note: runtime server logs are now written to `server/logs/` (ignored by `server/.gitignore`).
```

## How to verify V0.1 (quick)

Use these commands to run the deterministic smoke checks and produce artifacts you can inspect locally or upload from CI.

1. Run the server tests (fast verification):

```bash
# from the repo root
npm --prefix server test
```

2. Run the in-process export smoke (deterministic, fast):

```bash
# from the repo root
# This starts the server in-process and writes artifacts to /tmp and copies them to server/test-artifacts when running in CI
node server/scripts/run_export_test_inproc.js
```

3. Run the full export smoke with Chromium (CI-like):

```bash
# ensure Chrome is available on your PATH or set CHROME_PATH
PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=1 CHROME_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable npm --prefix server run verify-export
```

Artifact locations:

- `server/test-artifacts/` — artifacts copied here by the in-process smoke script when running in CI or when the directory exists locally.
- `/tmp/aetherpress-*` — temporary artifacts created by the smoke scripts (each run creates a unique temp dir).

Notes:

- For deterministic CI runs set `USE_REAL_AI=false` and `JOBS_DB=/tmp/tmp-jobs.db` to avoid external calls and shared DB state.
- If a PDF is generated, `server/pdfQuality.mjs` may be executed and its summary printed to stdout; CI workflows will fail on fatal validation errors.

## Scripts

- `scripts/ci-smoke-test.sh` — lightweight smoke test for the Generate→Preview endpoints. Usage: `./scripts/ci-smoke-test.sh http://localhost:3000` (requires `curl`, `jq`, and `python3`).
